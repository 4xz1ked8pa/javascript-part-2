# JavaScript part 2: functions and objects

* If you haven’t finished the previous assignment (excluding the challenges part), complete this first.
* Fork this repository and create a new Cloud9 project based on it.
* In this new project, create a branch called `functions`. Create a file called `functions.js`, put a line of comment inside of it, add/commit/push it, and create a pull request for this branch. Then, do the following. Each of these questions should be followed by a commit. This way, your PR will be updated and we can correct it.
  * Read about the [`Array.prototype.sort`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) method. Create a function that can be used with `sort`. This function should take two strings, and return a value that sort can use to determine which is the longest string. Finally, create an array of strings and try to get it sorted using your new function.
  * Create an array of objects (don’t need to use `new` here, just regular object literals). These objects will contain a `name` and `email` property. Then, run some code that will sort your array by the longest name. Then, run some code that will sort your array by e-mail address in alphabetical order.
  * Create a function that can be used with [`Array.prototype.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map). This function should take a number and return its square. Then, use this function with map on an array of numbers to check the result.
  * Create a function that can be used with `Array.prototype.map`. This function should be able to take an object and square its “num” property. Then, use this function with map on an array of objects each containing a “num” property.
  * In a previous workshop, you had to create a function that took two numbers and an operation (add, sub, mult, …) and returned the result of the operation on the two numbers. Here we are going to do the same but at a higher order.
  Create a function called `operationMaker` that takes only a string called `operation` as argument. This string could be `“add”`, `“subtract”`, `“mult”` or `“div”`. Your function will **return a function** that will take two numbers and return the result of running operation on these numbers.
  The end result should let me do something like this:
    ```javascript
var adder = operationMaker(“add”);
var sum = adder(5, 10); //15

var multiplier = operationMaker(“mult”);
var product = mult(5, 10); // 50
```
* Create a branch called `warriors`. Inside, create a file called `warriors.js`, and put a comment inside the file. Add/commit/push it and create a pull request for this branch. Then, do the following. Commit and push as often as you like so that we can monitor the progress of your code in the pull request. Don't hesitate to commit mistakes or incomplete code.
  * Create a constructor function called `Warrior` that can create new warriors. This function will take parameters `name`, and `gender`. `name` can be any string, `gender` can be `M` or `F`. It should create a warrior that has these properties:
    * `name`: the value that was passed to the constructor
    * `gender`: the value that was passed to the constructor
    * `level`: 1
    * `weapon`: wooden sword
    * `power`: a random number between 1 and 100
  * In addition to that, every object that gets created should have the following methods:
    * `fight`: will output to the console: "<name> rushes to the arena with <his/her> <weapon>"
    * `faceoff`: faceoff takes one argument called `opponent`. Based on the `power` of each opponent, this method should output to the console which player won the fight based on their power. Be as creative as you like with the text of this method :)
  * Finally, create a bunch of warriors and make them fight together.
* Create a branch called `terrain`. Inside, create a file called `terrain.js` and put a comment inside the file. Add/commit/push it and create a pull request for this branch. Then, do the following. Commit and push as often as you like so that we can monitor the progress of your code in the pull request. Don't hesitate to commit mistakes or incomplete code. When you think you are done, **add a label to the pull request on GitHub** called "ready for review". This will notify us to check your code.
  * Create a constructor function called `Tile` that can create new tiles. This function will take parameters `x` and `y` and create an object that has these properties:
    * `x`: the value that was passed to the constructor
    * `y`: the value that was passed to the constructor
    * `height`: a random number between 1 and 3
    * `type`: a random word between `grass`, `rocks` or `water`
    * `condition`: a random word between `burning`, `normal` or `frozen`
  * In addition to that, every object that gets created should have the following methods:
    * `freeze`: if the object is burning, then its condition should change to `normal`. if the object is normal then its condition should change to `frozen` and if it is `frozen`, its `height` should increment by 1
    * `burn`: if the object is frozen, then it will become normal. if the object is normal, then it should change to `burning`. if it is already burning, then its height should decrement by 1 until it gets to 0.
  * Write a piece of code that will use the `Tile` constructor to create a 20x20 map of `Tile`s. The map will be a 2D array (array inside array).
  * Output the map to the console in the following way:
    * For each tile, output the height of the tile as an "icon" for that tile
  * Go thru all the map again, randomly burning and freezing some tiles. Then, re-output the map in the same way again
* Complete the following activity: http://reactivex.io/learnrx/
